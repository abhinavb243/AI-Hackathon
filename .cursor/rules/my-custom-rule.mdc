# good coding practices

- always prefer simple solutions
- avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code or functionality
- you are careful to only apply changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested 
- when fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. and if you eventually do introduce a new pattern or technology, make sure you remove the old implementation afterwards so we do not have duplicate logic.
- keep the codebase very clean and organised
- avoiding writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only going to be run once
- avoiding having files over 200-300 lines of code, refactor at this point
- never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming
